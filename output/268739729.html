Delivering hard to get nutrients
Cow & Gate Growing Up Milk has been tailored to deliver hard to get nutrients, as part of a balanced diet. Just two 150ml beakers every day help your toddler get the nutrients they need.
Vitamin D for strong bones
Omega 3 an essential fatty acid
Iron to support normal cognitive development
Why a different milk at 2 years?
As they grow, toddlers' nutritional needs are changing. That's why Growing Up Milk 2 3 years is a semi skimmed version, containing less fat.
This pack of Growing Up Milk contains 800g, because the powder is more concentrated than Growing Up Milk 1 2 years. So even though there is less powder, this pack will give you more 150ml servings than a 900g pack of Growing Up Milk 1 2 years.
