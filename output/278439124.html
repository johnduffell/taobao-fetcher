Why choose Cow & Gate anti reflux?
Most babies bring their feeds up occasionally and this is perfectly normal. Sometimes this occurs more frequently, or in larger quantities and this is known as regurgitation or reflux. If you are concerned that your baby is having frequent reflux you should speak to your healthcare professional before using this product. Cow & Gate anti reflux is a specially thickened formula with carob bean gum. Unlike starch based thickeners, carob bean gum thickens the formula on mixing and remains thick in the stomach, helping the feed to stay down.
Cow & Gate anti reflux is a nutritionally complete formula; you can use it to feed your baby as a sole source of nutrition from birth and as part of a weaning diet from 6 months to 1 year.
