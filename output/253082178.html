Comfort milk for the dietary management of colic and constipation
Cow & Gate comfort has been specially developed with reduced lactose, partially digested (hydrolysed) whey proteins and a special fat blend for the dietary management of colic and constipation. With its nutritionally complete formula, you can use it to feed your baby as a sole source of nutrition from birth and as part of a weaning diet from 6 months. Comfort is proven to help soften stools and can help tackle several potential causes of colic unlike other colic remedies.
Colic and constipation?
Digestive discomfort can affect babies due to the immaturity of their digestive systems. As a result babies may suffer from colic or constipation. This could be due to a reduced level of healthy bacteria in the gut or a reduced ability to digest lactose or protein.
Cow & Gate comfort has been specially developed with reduced levels of lactose, partially digested whey protein and a special fat blend. This special blend of ingredients means you may notice a change in your baby's stool consistency (looser) and colour (greener). This is perfectly normal.
Why choose Cow & Gate?
We've been feeding babies for generations, helping them grow up happily. We know how important it is to provide the right nutrition at every stage of your baby's development, that's why, together with our experts, we've developed the Cow & Gate Complete Care range.
